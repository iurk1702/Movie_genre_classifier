## Git Commands

Run these commands to commit and push:

```bash
# Add all new and modified files
git add .gitignore README.md requirements.txt render.yaml LICENSE CONTRIBUTING.md
git add app/ scripts/ train_and_save_model.py

# Commit with a descriptive message

# Push to GitHub (if remote is already set)
git push origin main

# OR if you need to set the remote first:
# git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
# git push -u origin main
```

## What's Excluded (via .gitignore)

- `.venv/` - Virtual environment
- `__pycache__/` - Python cache files
- `models/` - Trained model files (users train their own)
- `data/research/` - Generated research data (users generate their own)
- `cornell-moviedialog-corpus/` - Dataset (users download separately)
- `.DS_Store` - macOS system files
- `.env` - Environment variables

## After Pushing

1. **Verify the repository looks good on GitHub**
2. **Add a repository description** on GitHub
3. **Add topics/tags** like: `fastapi`, `nlp`, `machine-learning`, `movie-genre-classification`, `multi-label-classification`
4. **Consider adding a GitHub Actions workflow** for CI/CD (optional)

## Notes

- The dataset is not included (too large for GitHub)
- Model files are not included (users must train their own)
- Research data files are not included (generated by script)
- All necessary code and documentation is included
