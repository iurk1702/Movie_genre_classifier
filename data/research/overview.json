  "title": "Movie Genre Classifier using NLP",
  "objective": "Build a multi-label classifier that predicts movie genres from dialogue text using the Cornell Movie Dialog Corpus dataset.",
  "dataset_description": "The Cornell Movie Dialog Corpus contains 617 movies with 304,713 utterances from 9,035 characters. Each movie has metadata including genres, release year, IMDB rating, and number of votes.",
  "methodology": [
    "Data loading and preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal)",
    "Feature engineering using Bag of Words (CountVectorizer)",
    "Multi-label classification using OneVsRestClassifier with Logistic Regression",
    "Model evaluation using F1-score, precision, and recall metrics"
  ],
  "key_findings": [
    "11 genres (drama, thriller, action, comedy, crime, romance, sci-fi, adventure, mystery, horror, fantasy) cover 91% of the dataset",
    "Best model: OneVsRestClassifier with Logistic Regression using only CountVectorized Bag of Words",
    "Adding additional features (sentiment, dialogue count, etc.) caused overfitting",
    "Random Forest had higher precision but poor recall due to class imbalance"
